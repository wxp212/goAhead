            <p class="question"><a id="history"></a>Why is Embedthis Software supporting and distributing 
                the GoAhead WebServer?</p>
            <div class="answer">
                The GoAhead WebServer was originally written by Michael O'Brien, CEO of Embedthis and it remains a very
                popular to this day. With the acquisition of GoAhead by Oracle, Oracle asked Embedthis to support existing
                GoAhead WebServer customers and to offer commercial licenses for the GoAhead WebServer.
            </div>
            <a id="compare"></a>
            <p class="question">How does the GoAhead WebServer compare with Appweb?</p>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>The GoAhead WebServer is a simple, compact web server that has been widely ported to many embedded
                operating systems. Appweb is faster and more powerful &mdash; but requires more memory. If you need a very
                simple, low end web server and have little memory available, the GoAhead WebServer is ideal. If you need
                higher performance and extended security, then Appweb is the right choice.</p>
            </div>
            <a id="runTimeModules"></a>
            <p class="question">Can I disable features to minimize memory footprint at run-time?</p>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Yes. GoAhead has build-time configuration settings to select required features and minimize 
                memory footprint. See <a href="source.html">Building from Source</a> for details of
                the configuration options.</p> 
            </div>
            <p class="question"><a id="upload"></a>How can I upload large files?</p>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>You need to increase the LimitRequestBody limit in the goahead.conf file. This imposes a maximum
                upload file size. Some samples have a MAX_FILE_SIZE input field in the HTML form. This however, is 
                just a hint to the browser, and is only processed by some browsers.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="question"><a id="disableFeatures"></a>When I build from the source, can I
            disable features at compile time?</p>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Yes. When GoAhead is built from source, a single bld.h header controls exactly what features and
                modules are built into the server. For example, if you don't require SSL support,
                and you wish to minimize memory footprint, you can run:</p>
                <pre class="ui code segment">./configure --without ssl</pre>
            </div><a id="trace"></a>
            <p class="question">How can I trouble-shoot with trace?</p>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Run goahead or winGoAhead with the logging switch "-l". The logging switch takes the following
                parameters:</p>
                <pre>
goahead -l logName[:logLevel][.maxSize]
</pre>
                <p>Where logLevel is a number between 0 and 9. Zero is the least verbose. To debug HTTP requests, a
                level of 6 provides the detail of all the request / response exchanges. MaxSize is the maximum size of
                the log file in MB. When the maximum size is exceeded, the log file will be rotated to logName.old and
                a new log file will be started.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="question"><a id="minimalFootprint"></a>How small can I make GoAhead?</p>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>GoAhead 3 has about 115K of code. For a minimal footprint on GoAhead, use:</p>
                <pre class="ui code segment">
./configure --without all --set cgi=false --set javascript=false
</pre>
                <p>This will disable most features including CGI and Javascript but still provide a running web server.
                <p>Things to consider when building small:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Disable all possible features. In particular, disable the CGI and Javascript handlers</li>
                    <li>Don't build DEBUG. Use: <em>./configure -release</em></li>
                    <li>Use a small C-Library such as uClibc on embedded Linux systems</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <p class="question"><a id="cross"></a>How can I cross compile?</p>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>The GoAhead configure command has switches to specify the <b>build</b> system and the target system
                that will <b>host</b> GoAhead. For example:</p>
                <pre class="ui code segment">
./configure --platform vxworks-arm
</pre>
                <p>When cross compiling, you also need to tell configure about your cross-compilation tool chain. This
                means the names of your compiler, library archiver, and other utilities and flags. The configure program
                listens to the settings of the AR, CC, NM, RANLIB, STRIP, CFLAGS, IFLAGS and LDFLAGS environment
                variables and will pass their values into the build system. These will be used to define the
                cross-compilation tool chain. You can also specify an alternate build tool chain by using the same
                variables but with a BUILD_ prefix. For example:</p>
                <pre class="ui code segment">
DIR=/path/to/cross-tools ; \
AR=$DIR/bin/ar.exe \
CC=$DIR/bin/cc.exe \
LD=$DIR/bin/cc.exe \
NM=$DIR/nm.exe \
RANLIB=$DIR/ranlib.exe \
STRIP=$DIR/strip.exe \
CFLAGS="-I$DIR/include \
./configure --debug --platform linux-arm
</pre>
